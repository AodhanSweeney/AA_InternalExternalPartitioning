This repository holds code relevant to Sweeney et al., 2023

Training of CNNs used in Sweeney et al., 2023 was done on 1 Tesla GPU from Casper provided by NCARâ€™s Computational and Information Systems Laboratory.

Notebooks contain the code to train CNN's and make predictions based on observational data from 1980-2022. This code is created to be used as is, but requires the specific environment specified in the yml.
